# 不和 (fuwa)

不和 (fuwa, meaning "discord" or "disagreement") is a small Discord API wrapper for Node.js made as a kind of experiment and learning experience. Originally written in JavaScript, it is now being re-written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org).

**Note**: This library is not published to the [npm](https://npmjs.com) [registry](https://registry.npmjs.com), yet. It is planned to publish it once basic functionality is implemented.

## Installation

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 14.x.x or higher is required for this library.

Installing with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), npm or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is simple. I don't know any other package managers.

```sh
# with npm
npm install --save nearlysplat/fuwa

# with yarn
yarn add github:nearlysplat/fuwa

# with pnpm
pnpm add nearlysplat/fuwa
```
