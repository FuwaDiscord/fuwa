# 不和 (fuwa)

不和 is a simple, small and easy-to-use library for use in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to interact with the [Discord](https://discord.com) [API](https://discord.dev)

**Note**: This library is not published to the [npm](https://npmjs.com) [registry](https://registry.npmjs.com), yet. It is planned to publish it once basic functionality is implemented.

## Installation

Node.js version 16 or higher is required for this library.

Installing with [npm](https://npmjs.com), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or any other package manager for Node.js is simple. Simply run the following command (adapted to your current package manager, if applicable) in your terminal and you'll be ready to go!

```sh
# with npm
npm install --save nearlysplat/fuwa

# with yarn
yarn add github:nearlysplat/fuwa
```

**Note**: Since the package is currently under heavy development and is in early alpha, breaking changes _will_ happen sooner or later. To avoid those, test a commit you like and pin that commit.

## Optional dependencies

- **Erlpack**: For _very_ fast encoding/decoding of gateway messages. To use this feature, install [`erlpack`](https://npm.im/erlpack) as an npm dependency and pass `etf: true` to your `Client`'s options.
- **Kleur**: For coloured log output. To use this feature, install [`kleur`](https://npm.im/kleur) as an npm dependency and pass `logger: { colors: true }` to your `Client`'s options.
